Solutions for puzzles for AoC!

# Tutorial

  Fork this repository and open a IDE of your choice!

  IDEs I recommend!
  
   • Atom
    
   • JetBrains
    
   • Visual Code Studios
   
   • Intellj
  
  First, clone this repository onto your IDE, then choose a programming language that you will use for AoC, they're labeled as the file names.
   Let's say that you're wanting to use python for AoC, then you will open a command prompt/terminal, and then type `python python/day1/puzzle.py`. Once you type     that, the answer for **Day 1** would return.
